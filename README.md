Leveraging Machine Learning Algorithms to Mitigate Food Wastage in the United Kingdom's Food Supply Chain.
The project Leveraging Machine Learning Algorithms to Mitigate Food Wastage in the United Kingdom's Food Supply Chain" focuses on reducing food waste using various machine learning techniques. Using a comprehensive dataset that spans different stages of the supply chain, the project employs Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, Neural Networks, Ridge and Lasso Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, and AdaBoost to predict and minimize food waste. Implemented in Python within a Jupyter Notebook environment, the study includes data preprocessing steps like handling missing values, normalization, and hyperparameter tuning. This multi-algorithmic approach aims to offer actionable insights for stakeholders to implement targeted waste-reducing interventions, thereby enhancing sustainability in the food supply chain.
The analysis reveals that Gradient Boosting and Random Forest models provide the highest accuracy in predicting food waste, highlighting critical variables and stages in the supply chain that need targeted interventions. Correlation insights and detailed breakdowns of waste distribution identify significant inefficiencies, guiding policy and operational adjustments. These findings offer a robust, data-driven foundation for reducing food waste and enhancing sustainability in the UK's food supply chain.
